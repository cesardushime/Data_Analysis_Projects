- 👋 Hi, I’m Cesar Dushimimana
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and big data analysis, with a special niche in automation tasks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced skills in HTML, CSS, and a thorough course on Python programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project based on a software system in the form of a social media dashboard used in trading shops. I also intend to develop an online healthcare system connecting top-notch doctors, pharmacies, and patients while delivering the best services with zero delay/traveling.
